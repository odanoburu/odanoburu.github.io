◊synopsis{

An exploration of how the actions of individual lives impact one
another in the past, present and future, as one soul is shaped from a
killer into a hero, and an act of kindness ripples across centuries to
inspire a revolution.  }

◊opinion{

Probably my favorite film ever. It is so rich you can re-watch it
several times—in fact it is recommended to do so since it's too much
to grab in only one sitting. Its stories thread a philosophy of life
that I much enjoy.
