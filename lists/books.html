<article class="book" data-author="Naomi Klein" data-year="2014" data-title="This changes everything" id="Naomi_Klein-This_changes_everything-2014"><div class="metadata"><h2>This changes everything—Capitalism versus The Climate<a href="#toc">⤴</a></h2><h3>by <span class="author">Naomi Klein</span> (2014)—<span class="status">read</span></h3></div>
<div class="synopsis"><h4>Synopsis</h4><p>Forget everything you think you know about global warming. The really<span class="raw-linebreak"> </span>inconvenient truth is that it’s not about carbon—it’s about<span class="raw-linebreak"> </span>capitalism. The convenient truth is that we can seize this existential<span class="raw-linebreak"> </span>crisis to transform our failed economic system and build something<span class="raw-linebreak"> </span>radically better.</p><p>In her most provocative book yet, Naomi Klein, author of the global<span class="raw-linebreak"> </span>bestsellers The Shock Doctrine and No Logo, tackles the most profound<span class="raw-linebreak"> </span>threat humanity has ever faced: the war our economic model is waging<span class="raw-linebreak"> </span>against life on earth.</p><p>Klein exposes the myths that are clouding the climate debate. We have<span class="raw-linebreak"> </span>been told the market will save us, when in fact the addiction to<span class="raw-linebreak"> </span>profit and growth is digging us in deeper every day. We have been told<span class="raw-linebreak"> </span>it’s impossible to get off fossil fuels when in fact we know exactly<span class="raw-linebreak"> </span>how to do it—it just requires breaking every rule in the “free-market”<span class="raw-linebreak"> </span>playbook: reining in corporate power, rebuilding local economies, and<span class="raw-linebreak"> </span>reclaiming our democracies.</p><p>We have also been told that humanity is too greedy and selfish to rise<span class="raw-linebreak"> </span>to this challenge. In fact, all around the world, the fight for the<span class="raw-linebreak"> </span>next economy and against reckless extraction is already succeeding in<span class="raw-linebreak"> </span>ways both surprising and inspiring.</p><p>Climate change, Klein argues, is a civilizational wake-up call, a<span class="raw-linebreak"> </span>powerful message delivered in the language of fires, floods, storms,<span class="raw-linebreak"> </span>and droughts. Confronting it is no longer about changing the light<span class="raw-linebreak"> </span>bulbs. It’s about changing the world—before the world changes so<span class="raw-linebreak"> </span>drastically that no one is safe.   Either we leap—or we sink.</p><p>Once a decade, Naomi Klein writes a book that redefines its era. No<span class="raw-linebreak"> </span>Logo did so for globalization. The Shock Doctrine changed the way we<span class="raw-linebreak"> </span>think about austerity. This Changes Everything is about to upend the<span class="raw-linebreak"> </span>debate about the stormy era already upon us.</p></div>

<div class="opinion"><h4>Opinion</h4><p>I agree with most of the diagnosis of the problem and with the general<span class="raw-linebreak"> </span>idea towards a solution. I’m not so sure about the specificities of<span class="raw-linebreak"> </span>the solutions—free trade still seems like a good thing to me, just<span class="raw-linebreak"> </span>like free migration.</p></div>
