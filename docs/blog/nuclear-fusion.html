If you are not excited about fusion energy, you should be. In case you
already are, you should read the book <a href="https://www.iter.org/newsline/-/3232">‘The Future of Fusion Energy’</a>
(assuming you haven&rsquo;t already, or are specialist). This will give you
a better understanding of why fusion is necessary, what are the
challenges to achieving it, how far we have come, and how far it could
take us. If you are not excited about fusion energy (yet), well, will
you give it a try?  I promise it&rsquo;s worth it.
</p>

<p>
‘The Future of Fusion Energy’ sums up the case for fusion energy in an
educated layman&rsquo;s terms — there&rsquo;s neither handwaving nor too
complicated physics. Anything that&rsquo;s remotely complicated goes into
optional sections that do not detract from the users understanding.
</p>

<p>
The book goes beyond mere physics and engineering, though, delving
into energy (and environmental) policy and nuclear proliferation. It
argues it&rsquo;s impossible for us to depend solely on renewable energy
sources for our energy needs. Some of this argument depends on making
assumptions about the efficiency of batteries and other technologies,
but there&rsquo;s quite a bit of physical <i>reasons</i> as to why we can never
get all of our energy needs from wave or geothermal or biofuel
energy. (Solar and wind wouldn&rsquo;t be physically impossible, probably
only economically and politically impossible.)
</p>

<p>
So we need another energy source, and the best we have is not good
enough. Fusion energy has all the benefits of fossil fuels: it&rsquo;s
efficient, can be produced anywhere, and can adapt to fluctuating
demand. Even better, fusion has none of their downsides, be it
pollution that poisons the air we breathe and the water we drink or
carbon release that destabilizes the climate. Its advantages are
similar to that of nuclear fission, with lots of energy produced with
very little fuel and space used. Compared to fission, however, fusion
produces less radioactive waste, both in quantity, in radioactivity,
and in a lower half-life. Fusion also has very small nuclear
proliferation preoccupations: in a world with fission energy use no
one would opt to use fusion to obtain nuclear materials for a weapon
(fission would make the task much easier), and in a world without
fission this kind of misuse of a fusion reactor could be easily
detected by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Atomic_Energy_Agency">IAEA</a> or other organs.
</p>

<p>
Fusion energy might sound too good to be true, but the only gotcha is
that achieving a fusion power plant is hard and will take a lot more
investment than we currently provide for it. The authors make a good
case that fusion research advanced very rapidly while it had
significant investment (during the cold war and oil crises), and that
it should enjoy the same advancement if we were to invest more in it
again. Even with the mediocre investment we give it today, we have
exciting prospects. We shouldn&rsquo;t be contented with that, however: we
should strive for more.
</p>

<p>
We need fusion <i>for yesterday</i>. It would make our energy transition
painless, our cities less noisy and with clean air, our electricity
bills lower, and did I also mention that it might make space travel
way faster? If you have any reservations, give the book a read, they
are probably discussed there!
