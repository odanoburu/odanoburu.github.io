In Brazil many jobs in the public sector are filled via civil service
exams (‘concursos públicos’), as a way of selecting professionals with
little risk of influence peddling or bias (which is not to say these
exams are equitable, hence why there are also affirmative action
measures). These exams also serve as a selection process for companies
whose majority owner is the government, such as the national oil
company Petrobras.

<p>
Brazilians generally view public sector jobs as desirable, given that
they usually pay more than their private sector counterparts (for
those jobs that do have private sector counterparts), and are more
stable (some even have stability guarantees, but not those in
companies such as Petrobras).
