This is a short note to record a few pointers that should help a
newcomer learn <a href="http://grammaticalframework.org/">GF</a>. In case you don&rsquo;t know what GF is:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Grammatical Framework (GF) is a domain-specific programming language
for grammar writing. It is a functional programming language, with
syntax inspired by the Haskell programming language; it draws from
intuitionistic type theory for its type system.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I wrote a short introduction to GF in my <a href="http://hdl.handle.net/10438/27405">MSc thesis</a> (which is about
implementing a GF grammar for Portuguese), but the best source for
learning GF is pairing the <a href="http://www.grammaticalframework.org/gf-book/">GF book</a> with a read of <a href="https://inariksit.github.io/blog/">Inari Listenmaa&rsquo;s
blog</a>. If you don&rsquo;t have so much time as to read a book, you can
checkout the somewhat old <a href="http://www.grammaticalframework.org/doc/tutorial/gf-tutorial.html">GF tutorial</a> or the <a href="http://www.grammaticalframework.org/lib/doc/rgl-tutorial/index.html">GF Resource Grammar
Library (RGL) tutorial</a> (I&rsquo;d pick the former if you are more of a
programmer than a linguist, and the latter if the contrary).
</p>

<p>
Installing GF from binary is straightforward, and is probably the best
course of action if you are not familiar with Haskell (the language of
implementation) tooling. That&rsquo;s all you need for playing around, but
as soon as you want to contribute grammars you probably want to clone
the <a href="http://github.com/grammaticalframework/gf-rgl">RGL repository</a> and build the latest versions of its grammars (you
don&rsquo;t need Haskell for that, only <code>bash</code> or <code>cmd</code>).
</p>

<p>
If you need help or have questions the best forum is probably the the
<code>gf-dev</code> <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/gf-dev">mailing list</a>, but the <code>#gf</code> channel on freenode is good help
too.
