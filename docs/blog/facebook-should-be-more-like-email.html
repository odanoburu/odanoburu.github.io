do you use facebook because it is the best platform available or just
because all your friends are already on it? what about whatsapp versus
telegram/signal/wechat? do you really have an option in choosing what
platform you&rsquo;ll use?
</p>

<p>
these kinds of services are subject to what economists call <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect"><i>network
effects</i></a>.  from wikipedia:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
a network effect (also called network externality or demand-side
economies of scale) is the effect that one user of a good or service
has on the value of that product to other people. When a network
effect is present, the value of a product or service is dependent on
the number of others using it.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
so what? well, this means that a service like facebook can acquire
value <b>intrinsic to its wide adoption, not to its quality</b>. in plain
terms, it means that you (and everyone) may be stuck with a worse
service simply because the cost of coordinating everyone to change
from bad-but-widely-adopted service A to better-but-not-widely-adopted
service B can be too high.
</p>

<p>
this network effect is a market failure if there ever was one, and
this needs to change. it hurts both personal and market freedom, and
disincentives innovation, giving the companies that developed these
services undue market power.
</p>

<p>
these kinds of services should be behave more like email: they should
all be based on an open format/protocol that allows other people or
other companies to develop products/services that can interact with
the original service. this would reduce these services&rsquo; market power
by allowing for true competition (i.e., one that is not hindered by
the service&rsquo;s network effect) to take place.
</p>

<p>
can you imagine if email were like facebook or whatsapp? we would all
have to be using the same provider and the same apps. you would not be
able to choose between the thousands of different providers (like
gmail, hotmail, and lesser known paid-only services), between the
thousands of email clients (webapps, outlook, thunderbird, sendmail,
etc.). you&rsquo;d have to use EmailCorp©&rsquo;s app and service. of course, you
could create your own email-like service. but everyone already uses
EmailCorp©&rsquo;s product. why would they change to yours if they wouldn&rsquo;t
be able to talk to their friends/partners/clients/bosses/colleagues
before getting them all to change services too? maybe this could work
if EmailCorp©&rsquo;s email <b>really</b> sucked, but what if it were just <i>kind
of</i> bad? you wouldn&rsquo;t be able to get most people to change, and you&rsquo;d
not be able to compete in equal terms with EmailCorp©. this doesn&rsquo;t
happen with pizza (or most other products, either). if this pizza
place is only <i>kind of</i> good, you don&rsquo;t have to stick with it. <i>you
deserve the best fucking pizza in the world.</i> just like you deserve
the best messaging platform or the best social network platform.
</p>

<p>
<b>let&rsquo;s make it happen.</b>
</p>

<p>
but how?
</p>

<p>
one way is to enforce governmental regulation whenever a service
surpasses critical mass and acquires too much market power. the
government can then force the company responsible to open its service
to equally standing competitors. in the case of whatsapp, this would
mean making its messaging protocol open in such a way that could
message someone on whatsapp using another messaging app such as
telegram. once the precendent has been set, startup companies will be
incentived to develop open platforms from the start, so that they
won&rsquo;t have to change all their backend software if/when they reach
network critical mass.
</p>

<p>
another way out is to people actively deny consumption of services or
products that are not open. companies routinely do this in order to
prevent buyer lock-in: if your company grows reliant on a closed
platform from another company, your supplier acquires market power
over you. it can then raise its prices for no reason other than the
fact that you are dependent on them. take the example of Microsoft. in
the year you found your first company it might offer you a huge
discount on an Office package. when your staff becomes a little too
realiant on Excel or Word, it can then raise its prices up to point
where it is not worth for you to pay the price of getting your
employees used to other software. in order to prevent this, if a
company has a choice, it will prefer products/services which are open,
so that if a supplier loses competitiveness, they can switch
seamlessly to another one. this is precisely how customers should
behave. if a service offers you no way out of it, you should search
for better alternatives.

<p>
if you support this idea, or if you have any comments, let&rsquo;s talk! if
you have a catchy/marketable name for this kind of company, please
tell me, so that we can spread the word.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>how can this hurt my freedom if I&rsquo;m free to leave the service and
pick another want?</li>
</ul>

<p>
in a literal sense, you&rsquo;re right. you&rsquo;re still free to leave any
service. but we&rsquo;re not dealing in absolutes here. you still have a yes
or no choice, but what about the other possibilities I presented
above?  why can&rsquo;t you use the platform you want and your friend the
one she wants and so on? the fact is that your freedom is reduced,
even if it is not removed completely.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>how can these companies have market power if their services are
provided for free?</li>
</ul>

<p>
these companies do make money. facebook (which is also the owner of
whatsapp) has quite an impressive revenue. the catch is just that they
are not selling anything to facebook users, but to their advertisers
instead. and they only have the ability to keep on doing this for such
a profit is because they don&rsquo;t face competition on equal terms.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>these companies are in this position because they developed critical
mass, and they could only do so because they werebetter/innovative,
therefore they deserve their market power. right?</li>
</ul>

<p>
no. because time goes on, the market changes, and companies can fall out
of the cutting edge or stop providing a quality service. but because of
their market power, they don&rsquo;t suffer as much as a company in a truly
competitive market would (as in my pizzeria example).
