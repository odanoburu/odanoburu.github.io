* Me

I (= Bruno Cuconato) am currently a PhD student/candidate/researcher
at the computer science department at [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontifical_Catholic_University_of_Rio_de_Janeiro][PUC-Rio]]. Otherwise, I spend most
of my free time reading, hiking, and learning Japanese.

If you ever thought of visiting my hometown (Rio), you may find this
[[./visit-rio.org][guide]] useful.

** Contact
Feel free to contact me by email at =(first letter of my
name)cclaro+site= at google's email service.
