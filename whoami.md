## bruno cuconato

MSc candidate at the FGV Applied Mathematics School (EMAp/FGV). I was granted a full scholarship during my Bachelor's studies, majoring in Economics, with a minor in International Relations.

I have worked in public policy at the Rio de Janeiro city hall, and taught and interpreted asylum seekers at CÃ¡ritas-RJ.

I like programming and open-source, reading and hiking. I believe environmentalism should be our society's major concern today.
